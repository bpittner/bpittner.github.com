        <p>My name is Ben Pittner, and I'm a software consultant living and working in the DFW metroplex. I enjoy breaking down complex or obscure problems into simple, repeatable patterns that I can share with others. This blog is a place for me to document these solutions, and I hope you find some of them useful.</p>                 
        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, gaming, cooking, and all forms of fitness.</p>

        <p>Feel free to reach out to me by email if you have any questions!</p>
